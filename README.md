# 🏍️ Moto Matrix - Two-Wheeler Marketplace

Moto Matrix is a full-stack two-wheeler marketplace web application that allows users to **browse, compare, and book bikes/scooters**, while also providing dealers and sellers with tools to **list and manage vehicles**.  
The project follows a **MERN-inspired architecture**: React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), and MongoDB (database).

## 📌 Problem Statement Reference
**Problem Statement Chosen:** Online Two-Wheeler Marketplace (Moto Matrix)  
**Reason to Choose:** To build a modern platform where users can easily search, compare, and book two-wheelers, while dealerships can seamlessly list and manage vehicles.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview
**Proposed Approach:**  
Develop a responsive web app with React frontend and Express backend that integrates with MongoDB for data storage. The platform supports **vehicle browsing, test ride booking, wishlist management, showroom locator, and calculators**.

**Key Features / Modules:**
- Vehicle browsing & advanced search
- Vehicle detail pages with images, specs, and reviews
- Vehicle comparison tool
- Wishlist management
- Secure authentication with JWT
- Test ride booking system
- EMI & fuel cost calculators
- Showroom locator with maps
- Used bike listings and sell flow

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
**Workflow:**  


**Data Flow:**
- Users interact with the React app
- API requests go to Express backend
- Backend authenticates and processes logic
- MongoDB stores/retrieves data
- Response sent back to frontend

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
**Frontend:** React 18, React Router, Styled Components, Framer Motion, React Query, Axios  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, JWT, Bcrypt, Express Validator  
**Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)  
**APIs / Libraries:** Leaflet (map integration), React Toastify, React Icons  
**Development Tools:** Concurrently, Nodemon, ESLint, Prettier  

---

## 🔎 Algorithms & Models
- **Chosen Algorithms:** Filtering & comparison logic, JWT-based authentication, input validation  
- **Reason:** Lightweight, scalable, and suited for real-time web apps  
- **Model Training:** Currently mock-data based, but future ML enhancements may include recommendation systems  

---

## 📊 Data Handling
- **Sources:** Mock dataset with 20+ vehicles, 500+ reviews, 31+ showrooms  
- **Preprocessing:** Structured by brand, model, variants, images by model/color/angle  
- **Storage:** MongoDB schemas for Users, Vehicles, Showrooms, Bookings  

---

## 🚀 Implementation Plan
1. **Initial Setup & Environment** → Install Node, React, MongoDB, dependencies  
2. **Core Module Development** → Auth, Vehicles, Wishlist, Booking system  
3. **Integration & Testing** → Connect frontend + backend, validate with mock data  
4. **Deployment-ready Build** → Deploy React on Vercel/Netlify and backend on Render/Heroku with MongoDB Atlas  

---

## ✅ Performance & Validation
**Evaluation Metrics:**  
- API response time  
- Page performance (Lighthouse)  
- Authentication reliability  
- Booking success rate  

**Testing Strategy:**  
- Unit testing for backend APIs  
- Integration testing for frontend-backend  
- Manual functional testing for features  

---

## ☁️ Deployment & Scalability
**Deployment:**  
- Frontend → Vercel / Netlify  
- Backend → Render / Heroku  
- Database → MongoDB Atlas  

**Scalability:**  
- Docker-based CI/CD pipeline  
- Load balancing for backend  
- Cloud image storage (AWS S3 / Cloudinary)  
- Future ML-driven recommendations
